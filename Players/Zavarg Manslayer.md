Zavarg, a proud warrior of [[Phasel]], hailed from the Southern and most advanced Barbarian tribe on the [[Continent of Vinna]]. His strength and tactical mind earned him the rank of captain, and he held deep respect for the warriors under his command. They, in turn, admired Zavarg, not only for his combat prowess but for his unwavering commitment to their survival and victory. He cared for his men as if they were family, and they followed him with unwavering loyalty.

When word of an assault from [[Buramog]], a rival tribe known for their brutish ways, reached [[Phasel]], [[Zavarg Manslayer]] was entrusted with a critical mission: hold the bridge. He knew [[Buramog]] to be crude and reckless, but when they arrived, they wielded magics that neither [[Zavarg Manslayer]] nor his tribe had anticipated. His battle-hardened instincts kicked in, and with his men at his side, Zavarg charged into the fray, carving a path through the [[Buramog]] forces with his halberd.

Despite his rage-fueled power, Zavarg was no fool. He fought with precision, and his experience in battle gave him a clear understanding of the ebb and flow of combat. However, as the tide of battle turned, he saw his comrades falling one by one. The realization that his side was losing gnawed at him as he pressed forward, but then it happened—his eyes locked onto one of the Buramog mages.

A blinding flash of magic seared through his vision, igniting a fire deep within him that he could not control. The world around him blurred, the sounds of war fading into the background. In that moment, Zavarg lost himself completely to the primal fury within. His halberd moved like a whirlwind, cutting down everything in its path—enemy and ally alike. Blood stained the ground as he tore through both sides, his mind a fractured storm of rage. Flashes of faces—friends, comrades—flickered through his thoughts, but the fury drowned out any sense of reason. The battle became a slaughter, and when the dust settled, Zavarg was the only one left standing amidst the carnage.

Imprisoned by his own people, Zavarg was sentenced to execution for his crimes. But instead of death, he was sold into a life of servitude as an indentured warrior for [[Standa]], a distant land where gladiators fought for the amusement of the wealthy. Shackled and bound, Zavarg was forced into brutal combat, his life no longer his own, his rage a tool for others’ entertainment.

Tales of his savage prowess soon spread far beyond Standa’s borders, eventually reaching the ears of the [[King of Sena]]. Intrigued by the legend of this fearsome warrior, the King sent word to Standa and arranged for Zavarg’s purchase. Shackled and caged, Zavarg was transported across the sea, shipped to [[Sena]] as little more than a weapon to be wielded for the King’s pleasure.

Upon arrival, the King offered Zavarg a deal—fight in the royal pits, win your freedom, and one day, complete a task of great importance. The choice was not his to refuse.

Thrown into the gladiatorial pits, Zavarg fought with ruthless precision, no longer the berserker who lost control. He learned to channel his rage, to use it deliberately. The lessons of his past weighed heavily on him, and he refused to let the fury consume him again. In the pits, he became a force of nature, defeating foe after foe, earning the infamous title "Manslayer" for both his gladiatorial victories and his battlefield crimes.

After years of bloodshed, Zavarg was finally released from the pits, his freedom granted—but not without a price. The [[King of Sena]] left him with one final condition: complete a special task, and he would earn his place as a free bugbear and citizen of Sena. With little more than a pittance of gold and a handful of items, Zavarg now roams the world, a warrior seeking redemption for his past sins, waiting for the King’s call to fulfill his final mission.
