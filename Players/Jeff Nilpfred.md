How he got here: He was transported to this [[Tredracomundus]] with no memories and only a small, palm-sized, glowing crystal of unknown origins

He does not know where he came from. He has a nagging feeling of loss in the back of his mind. Whether that be friends or family or home.

He moved from where he was stranded in this land to the nearest major city of [[Sena]]. He has deciphered what he can from the stone, unlocking secrets from his past and giving him the faintest instinct of how to cast novice cantrips and spells. He was able to use the stone as, not just a focus, but a (limited) power source. Quickly, he found that he could use the stone's power to more easily melt, mold, and craft metal (his artificer's artisan tool). It was not only easy, it felt natural. Moreover, he felt that he was just scratching the surface of his potential. For the last 3 months, he's been working for the local blacksmith saving up a wage to branch out and find answers that linger at the back of his mind and unlock the potential secrets of his arcane focus.

He practices his combat in the local arena (or tavern) preferring an unarmed fighting style due to his massive size.

He feels he may be finally ready to leave, but is waiting for a sign from the universe to push him on his way
