Arriving to [[Pisce]] 8pm on Wednesday the 5th

Fabina runs Pices

  
[[Fabina]] told us about the [[Zenterim]]: local [[Thieves' Guild]] (mob) they let them be because pices has agents inside. They weed out the smallers thieves guild.

Theyre trying to sell off the patent of royalty worth 2000 platinum

Pices follows the god [[Waukeen]] –

Thieves follow [[Syric]]; god of lies and trickery

  
as were eating dinner and [[Fabina]] gives us potions of long rest a zombie teleports into this anti magic room, [[Wilgo]] gets sucked into [[viajar]]s lamp

in pice is an 85 foot tower made of marble and glass it’s the thieves guild

on the first “boss” we killed in the tower of the thieves guild, rings of keys and +1 longsword

The tower is tiered and looked to have between 3-7 floors/4 cake tiers tall
