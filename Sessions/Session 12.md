[[Howlest Quin]] is the undertaker prepping bodies. [[Our Gravest Condolences]] buries the bodies

[[Viajar]] and [[Wilgo]] are talking to the undertaker shop runner ([[Mr. Quinn]]) and he is freaking out being asked questions about the zombies

Viajar cast suggestion on the dad to tell them whats wrong: “[[Imlic]]” is a loanshark in town. Probs part of the [[Thieves' Guild]]. [[Mr. Quinn]] got in dept gambling with the loanshark. Hes massively in debt. The bodies are being replaces with mannequins and being given to imlic. Imlic is located at the blue X to the left of the graveyards. Mr quinns debt is 5x platinum. He’s sent at least 8 bodies to imlic.
