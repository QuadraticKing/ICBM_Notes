During rest, vivid dreams: seeing a lich, gowned skeletal figure. Approach them, feel like im a ghost observing. See 2 men walk up to the figure with 1 zombie. The zombie approaches and the lich says I am [[Horobond]], leave this place or be destroyed. The zombie flails its arms and disappears. The lich looks at me and says who sent me. I see Wilgo through the door and the party is there and they cant see me. ([[Wilgo]] had a dream similar to this)
