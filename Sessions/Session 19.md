We teamed up (paid 50g to a party) with a group to find [[Albie]] given that we were promised a bigger reward

Notes about [[Caramore]]: all dwarves

All of the townspeople meet on Sunday at 9pm

Staking out the meeting: man from the pub, bartender, dwarf with drum and guitar, 2x horribly disfigured hags

They’re plotting against us, not afraid of me (the lead hag thinks she can take me) the sub hag looks not sure. The both think they can take viajar and Wilgo

Drum guy ([[Dugal]]) hasn’t met us. Wants to meet with Mr. Macheath (bartender)’s wife later to discuss this.

[[Darian]] (regular at the pub) spends his evenings at the inn, they may go meet later at the inn

[[Mother Gloam]] will handle the deamoness while townspeople handle us. [[Dugal]] doesn’t care about deamon and wants to find Gwendallin (stolen by [[Albie]], NOT murdered)

 Hag lady turns into a fox (main one) man hag opens the door for her (Wilgo knows it would be weird for a hag to be working with a demon)

Almost got spotted in the field by the fox hag lady (Mother Glome)

Hags live in Lairs. (This one may live in Hag House in the town) Male hag is Son [[Trevis]]

Coming up to our meeting time, darian, laura and a small blonde girl climbing up into the ceiling from a ladder

Going to [[Lane]]’s camp to catch them up to speed

Albie did not kidnap the girl- Lane

This town is cursed by a devil

Hag is the defacto mayor

Almost the whole town is in on this except her

Gwen is NOT Lauras daughter, its Darians daughter

Blonde girl at tavern is a stowaway that got here after gwen was taken 2 weeks ago found by the footsteps of the church

High ranking devils are able to hire demons out to people

Private conversation with Lane - Albie is alive, gloam is evil, Albie lives in a cave at the top of the hill on  the way to the church. If I go see him, watch my back. Come back tomorrow night, shell see albie to get a timeline of happenings. Gwen showed up dating albie, she left house and fell asleep, mother gloom came in and probs took her.

This city has been cursed for years

3 Sundays ago during the town meeting albie and gwen don’t come to  the meeting

Went to the church and found an altar basement a demon was on the other side of the door with gwen bound gagged and blindfolded

Demon has legendary resistances

Demons attacks are labeled “[[Aspect of Baalphegor]]”

We FUCKED him up, I probably saved viajars life by dragging the aspect away from them
