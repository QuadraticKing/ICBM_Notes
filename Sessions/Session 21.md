Headed back to [[Sena]]

Get to a tavern and there is a caravan of 8 people that started out with 7. Trying to find the imposter.

-The man “married” to the woman seems odd. Hes missing a mole and the wife doesn’t know if hes actually her husband “George prince and connie prince” Shes having a hard time remembering what his face is supposed to look like. Woman cant remember anyone on the carriage

-Old couple (Peter and Rose Cramer) woman says husband is acting weird. And being mean. Old man being grotesque

-Solo woman blonde hair: on her way to oblitu. Family in oblitu and then going for work in pices (Ethel)

-Room vibes: Everyone has a sense of fear in the room.

-Old drunkard: came from space, slightly crazy, has been everywhere, knows of ICBM, probed his mind and he was looking at 5 more people in the carriage.

Its about 10 pm when all the guys went to look at the bridges

Walked everyone back to their rooms and viajar set up watch in the hallway

[[Vampire Barkeep]] may have darkvision? (viajar made me write it down)

An Oni ([[Fat Merchant]]) lures [[viajar]] away and sneak attacks him

Bartender is a vampire

I am compelled to fight viajar

Vampire made a movement and we heard howling; it summoned 10 wolves (3d6)

I downed viajar

We killed the vampire and find he killed everyone upstairs

Looting old crazy man: 14gold

Knocked out 2 vampire teeth

Threw him in the water

Looted his dresser and found 1 gallons of blood

Staking a vampire paralyses him and prevents him from returning to resting place

Only way to kill a vampire is to destroy resting place or make sure they cant return to the resting place

Filled up a vial with vampire dust

Prying open the barrels:

100g middle barrel

Clothes and tools n stuff in other barrels

Took a short rest so Wilgo could summon us a safe place to rest for a long rest
