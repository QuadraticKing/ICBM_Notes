Silver sword missing that [[Fuego Caliente]] lent to an unnamed man

Given 4x magical items and the promise of a reward for returning the sword

Go get it and bring it back within 3 days before the shipment leaves for the boss of: ([[Thalasson]] or [[Saltatio]])

1 days travel from [[Sena]] in a graveyard to the south west near the coast

We made it to the [[Grackurt]] nearly after 11pm and found the graveyard.

Instead of sleeping and waiting for the morning we chose to go to the graveyard that a man went missing in and were surprised by 2 skeletons and 2 undead dogs. The dogs were possessed by their specter families.

We fought valiantly and killed the reanimated dead with haste. [[Saltatio]] and [[Wilgo]] used ranged magic to weaken the dead, cause ranged damage, and prevent imminent disaster with silvery barbs. [[Thalasson]] charged headfirst into the undead mongrels sustaining nearly critical damage before laying hands on himself until nearly full-on health. [[Jeff Nilpfred]] bit off more than he could chew attempting to be a tank with no real skills or armor to back up that status. Many failed rolls on our side and at least 2 critical rolls on the specters side left Jeff dead and the party shellshocked. The party investigated the nearest house and the hole within, noticing a creature visible that they couldnâ€™t quite make out.

The party considered bringing Jeff to a nearby shrine to see the price of resurrection before continuing into this perilous crypt.

This is where we left session.
