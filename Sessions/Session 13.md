[[Stokeslot]] is the mongrelman

[[Liira]] is the fish priestess

Were down here looking for where [[Imlic]] is going

The mongrelman has an 8 inch thic almanac that is their journal of knowledge. Started in common and slowly devolved into scribbles and runes.

Mongrelmen bred with humans after the collapse of their city into the depths.

There are now 20 mongrelmen in the city in the caves. Families are guarded by beasts and rats

I, [[Zavarg Manslayer]] helped make the mongrelmen race stronger by making a bugbear hybrid with the eggs they have laying around

Tried to convince [[Stokeslot]] to not invade the overworld with new strong babies, maybe make peace

Abjuration=shielding/protection, the [[Upside-down Cave Tower]] is covered in that magic

The walls look very familiar to something I’ve seen before, I rolled too low to know what it was

[[Viajar]] found on a skeleton a magic abjuration ring

I found bracers emitting magic glowing blue with enchantment magic: identify bracers of hold person

Cleared 12 zombies out of the tower then separated from each other too loot  
“may the 3 servants of __ entropy whose names are __chaos  __despair __ death reveal the one true way –

“[[Horobond]] – who sent you”

Hollow globe I found in my room, 3 potions, and 3 vials of 8d goo

Inside the globe [[Wilgo]] found a scroll; scroll of detect magic

I lopped off a grapefruit size chunk of obsidian from the obsidian desk

We speak the passphrase and get teleported to horrobond.

[[Kelthostrine]] was the leader of this corpse prison

Priests we murdered have on them: scroll – they were all in prison for revolting against keltostrine when they were slaves. They were thrown in prison here. Earthquake happened and they excavated out after decades.

Fighting ghosts, wilgo is possessed, viajar stabbed him.

DENIS WILL RECAP NEXT SESSION
