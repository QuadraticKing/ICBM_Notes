Now the 8th of may in game

We are fighting our way through the puzzle dungeon starting in [[Grackurt]]with [[Motte Hayat]] looking for [[Papel]]

On the 3rd room we fight a babau in a room of darkness

Found in one of the rooms [[Wilgo]] let me identify and wear Necklace of internal recovery:

(I attuned to it last rest in dungeon)

The puzzle isnâ€™t matching up with the rooms we found. When we were supposed to go right the first time there was no door so we had to go down again.

Got a giant potion from a chest after going right in the maze dungeon (ilixir of health)
