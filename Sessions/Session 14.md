Full plate armored red dragonborn guarding desk room as I peek down

These guys are going to try [[Kelthostrine]]

Have not tried: entropy, chaos, despair, death, keltos or strine

Old mans name is *Now* [[Old Dylan]] ac 17

Dragonborns name is [[Mandarich]]

Dylan died like an asshole and a ghastly spirit came out of his body

We turned [[Mandarich]] to help us kill the ghost and now were out of combat

“Mayor interacts with man in armor and higher ups in thieves guild. Allow crime.”

Mandarich is from [[Cruz]] and was shipped here as a slave. Offered to make him captain of our ship if he helps us.

The phrase “chaos  __despair __ death” worked to get through door #1  
  

2nd door was a gas trap, had to bust it down after blocking the vent holes

Black (conjuration), smoky white(necromancy) , purple gem (evocation) eyes glued to the 3rd door that’s locked

Smashing all the buttons hurt [[Wilgo]] but opened the door.
