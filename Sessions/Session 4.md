Starting at 8pm

[[Motte Hayat]] cured my poison

[[Papel]] has a good singing voice I guess. The town misses her

Gave 30.88 gold to each member  
I have a glowing shield and a picture of mott on the front of it

Potion shop, general store, a bar, 1 blacksmith

How much is [[Fuego Caliente]] Greatsword that’s hung up, a robot (possible [[Viajar]] sibling) from [[Borger]] left it – [[Jeremy the blacksmith]] asking [[Jeff Nilpfred]]

We’re in [[Grackurt]]

Contents of vials:

**3x holy water**

**1x potion of deep sleep**

**5x oil**

**3x poison**

**19x Rest = possible piss mixture**

The only wizard that can help [[Viajar]] is in [[Borger]]

**IN THE DUNGEON**

We went right and right, found a swarm of rats

In the river, gold staff with a hand missing a gem. The shaft is gemmed out the wazzu

North of the sketchy river monster skinny hallway led into an open burial chamber with material components

Opening my sarcophagus: tentacle monstrocity

#2: brazier, 4x torches

#3: tigereye gem worth 100g

#4: 5 rings 15g tigereye left hand all pearl rings 10g ea. I have 2 each left saving one for saltatio

#5: copper crown 2g, and a mace

Check rations for spoiled food later

[[Viajar]] found on [[Papel]]**: a wedding ring, a scroll and a notebook

[[Papel]] stole [[Motte Hayat]] eyesight

We went into the mirror. The horrors dropped magical items but were too much for the 3 of us. [[Viajar]] got bagpipes and [[Wilgo]] got bag of cleanliness
