## For the Dungeon Master
### Arc 1 - Invasion of the Beasts
2 Weeks Ago, a logging outpost South of Oriento was attacked by what could only be described as a Thunderbeast. The militia was able to fight it back and kill it, but before they could send anyone back to the logging outpost, there was another one at the Southern Wall of Oriento. Again, the Militia was able to fight it off, but the assaults keep happening, and risking soldiers to fend off the assault is not helping.

Xorigat, a Traxigor was was able to plane shift back to Tredracomundus about a month ago. In a horrible mistake, about 70 years ago the Arch-Wizard Planeshifted himselft, in an attempt to get to Elysium, ended up on Krigala in the Beastlands. After spending decades in Krigala, Xorigat decided to polymorph himself into a beast to not draw suspicion to himself by taking the form of an Allosaurus. The spell affected his mental and he forgot how to Planeshift himself back and for 70 years he was stuck on Krigala, hiding from Dinosaurs and slowly forgetting what he looked like.

While attempting to Polymorph himself back, he has been attempting to True Polymorph other woodland beings into him, but they all keep coming out as Dinosaurs. The longer he goes, the more he forgets what he initially looked like. If the party could help him find himself again he would surely leave them be with no trouble.
